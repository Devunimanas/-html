There are several types of air pollution, including: 
Particulate matter (PM): A mixture of small particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. PM is made up of many different things, including sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust, and water. PM can be classified as fine, ultra fine, or coarse, depending on its size. 
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): A reddish-brown gas that's a strong oxidant and soluble in water. 
Ozone (O3): A major component of smog, formed through photochemical reactions in the presence of heat. 
Carbon monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless gas produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels like wood, petrol, coal, natural gas, and kerosene. 
Sulfur dioxide (SO2): A colorless gas that's soluble in water. 
Lead: A pollutant that's regulated by the EPA. 
Greenhouse gases: Gases like carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to climate change. 
Radon (Rn): A radioactive gas that can concentrate in basements and ground levels of homes. 
Common sources of air pollution include household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities, and forest fires.
